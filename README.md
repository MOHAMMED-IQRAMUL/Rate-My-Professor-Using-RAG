# ProfessAI Documentation

## Overview
**ProfessAI** is an AI-powered support assistant built to streamline the process for students seeking to find and evaluate professors. This tool uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines information retrieval with natural language generation, enabling students to quickly access information about professors based on their specific needs and preferences.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Retrieval:** ProfessAI leverages a RAG system to combine traditional search with natural language generation, which allows it to understand user queries and provide relevant professor information.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Using natural language processing (NLP), ProfessAI can tailor results based on specific criteria such as teaching style, area of expertise, or student feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is deployed on Vercel, providing a responsive and accessible interface for students to navigate and access information.
- **Regular Updates and Easy Deployment:** With multiple deployments and ongoing development, ProfessAI is kept up-to-date to ensure optimal performance and user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Jupyter Notebooks for development), used for data processing and AI model training.
- **Frontend:** JavaScript and minimal CSS for the user interface.
- **AI/ML Frameworks:** The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system uses NLP models for information retrieval and generation.
- **Deployment:** Vercel is used for hosting and deployment.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Node.js 14+**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for AI model development.
  
### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/professai.git
   cd professai
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install JavaScript dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Deployment
ProfessAI is deployed on Vercel, and deployment configurations are already set up in the repository. For a local deployment, Vercel CLI can be used:
```bash
vercel
```

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can:
- Enter specific queries about professors based on their research interests, teaching methods, or other relevant attributes.
- Receive AI-generated recommendations and evaluations for professors.
- Refine searches based on additional criteria to find the best fit.
